# Module one final assessment exercise in Adalab.

The exercise consisted of laying out a web page using HTML5 and CSS3.

This exercise has been solved through the use of flexbox, grid, different types of positioning and some animations and transitions.
The index.html document was split into **partials**. The main.scss document was also segregated into different parts, thus saving code in some cases.
The result will be published on GitHub pages.

## Technologies

For this we have used the **Adalab Web Starter Kit**, created with node and gulp.

Among other things, ADWSK includes an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor, and a local server.
